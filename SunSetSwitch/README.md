## ESP-8266 SunSet Switch

This turns on at sunset and off later. Hard coded to RWC CA.

This works well on the LoL1n board, with ESP8266 chip.

Be aware that the board comes as 9600 baud, but this board seems to work fine
with 921600 baud. (default for LoL1N(WEMOS) D1 mini Pro, 80MHz QIO, per settings in Arduino IDE.


In other words, the initial upload will take a while, but subsequent uploads are quick.

Use Arduino IDE plus ESP8266 packages.
